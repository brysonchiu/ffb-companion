/*
This file seperates the starters, bench, and undrafted players and sorts them by VBD points. The steps are as follows:
  1) Estimates the starting players from the roster settings by filling the starting position roster slots and then filling in the flex spots with the next highest scoring eligable players. Stores starters data:
    - most starting points, array: [playerId, points]
    - fewest starting points, array: [playerId, points]
    - average bench points, number
    - playerCount, number
    - starting players, array of player IDs
  2) By doubling the starting positional roster size, we're able to estimate a faux bench. Because a bench slot can be any position, this can be used to gather data to use to model the actual bench. Stores faux bench data:
    - fewest bench points, array: [playerId, points]
    - average bench points, number
    - playerCount, number
    - bench differential (average of player points and fewest points), number
  3) Get bench players by calculating non starters VBD points. Stores bench data:
    - fewest bench points, array: [playerId, points]
    - bench players, array of player IDs
  4) Calculate rostered players point differential. This is average points from the last starter in each position.
    - point differential, array: [total point differential, rostered player count, average point differential]
  5) Calculate VBD points for all players.  This is used to sort players against other players in different positions. Stores data:
    - vbd points for starters, bench, undrafted, and all players
